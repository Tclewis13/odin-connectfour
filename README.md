Odin Connect Four Project.

This project has taught me that rspec is dogshit and I hate it. Look, I understand that automated tests are important, especially in larger and more complex projects, but using rpsec has been nothing but frustrating and a waste of time. The syntax is idiosyncratic. The documentation is awful. It's excruciating to find out how to do even the smallest, simplest things and even that seems to change frequently based on their release. 

I kept getting a deprecation method for using "should" on arrays and when I tried to find out what was supposed to replace "should" I could not with like half an hour of research. That is inexcusable. Tests in board_spec and space_spec work but half the ones in game_spec do not because of dumb shit like this. I will be switching to another test suite. 

Fuck Rspec.
